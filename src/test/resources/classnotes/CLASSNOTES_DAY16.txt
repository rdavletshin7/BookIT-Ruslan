Day 16 API Automation

Office hours:
Challenges in comcast project
Bugs:
Coding: API and UI validation

Cucumber BDD automation Framework:
	Full stack Test Automation. Supporting:
		-> UI -> java + Selenium WebDriver
		-> API -> java + RestAssured
		-> DB -> java + JDBC

Cucumber as BDD tool:
	-> adding feature files
	-> writing test scenarios in Gherkin language

Maven Build Tool => dependecy management and test execution(mvn clean install)

...................

Regression suite: there are close to 700 tests / cucumber scenarios
700 scenarios / 5 per feature file => around 150 feature files

Normally 700 is your manual regression suit and you automate around 80% which makes 560 automated scenarios. 400 of them api and database and 160  of them UI

------

I make sure to test each functionality with positive and negative tests.
And for each scenario I add a cucumber BDD scenario.

My framework supports UI , API , DB tests. So i organize my feature files and step def classes into seperate packages.

SCENARIO 1:
	UI: User logs in to web application in the browser and goes to profile info page.
	API: User sends GET request to retrieve profile info from REST API using access token.
	Then Verify that values are matching
	DB: User sends sql query to retrieve user profile data and verify that it is matching the UI and API data.

	If there are any mismatches, i report it and discuss with the team if it is an applicaiton issue/bug or it is expected.

BOOK IT scenario:

UI: Goto https://cybertek-reservation-qa.herokuapp.com
And login as team lead
team_leader_email=lfinnisz@yolasite.com
team_leader_password=lissiefinnis

Read all available room names.

Login
API: Send GET request to :api/rooms/available
With query params: year: 2022
					month: 2
					day: 21
					conference-type: SOLID
					cluster-name: light-side
					timeline-id: 11237

Then json response room names must match the UI result room names.

=============================================================

add new feature file: rooms.feature

BUG: That I found while developing automation:

1) Access token and credentials are visible in Chrome Network tab.

2) When we inspect the HTML code, the hidding values could be seen in html. but not in UI. EX: I logged in as non-admin user, then in HTML code, I can see the data that is not supposed to be visible to non-admin.
